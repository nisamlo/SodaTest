# SodaTest
The only part I have not been able to complete to the specification is the fonts.
I do not have the license to use or distribute the fonts used in the PSD file.

I have substituted Helvetica Neue in place of the PSD fonts.

The file "reset.css" is my file to reset site CSS to my defaults so that I am always staring with the same base.
